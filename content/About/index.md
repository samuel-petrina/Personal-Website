{{< figure src="skiing.jpeg" >}}

My name is Samuel Petrina and I am a third-year engineering student at Queen's University. I am currently working towards my BASc in mechanical engineering with a planned focus in robotics and mechatronics. Currently, my major project is the Queen's Formula SAE car for the 2023 season. This year, I am the team lead for the vehicle dynamics sub-team. Our team is responsible for the design and fabrication of the suspension, steering, and brakes systems. This has given me experience managing larger, long-term projects as well as significant design experience. We are planning to compete in the Formula SAE Michigan competition in May.

Outside of school and work, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast and woodworker. My favorite winter activity is skiing, both in-bounds and touring, primarily in and around Whistler. In the summer, I'm hiking and more recently, climbing with any spare time I can get. In essence, if I'm outside, I'm having a good time. If the weather is not so friendly, I enjoy working on a variety of woodworking projects.
