My name is Samuel Petrina and I am a third-year engineering student at Queen's University. I am currently working towards my BASc in mechanical engineering with a planned focus in robotics and mechatronics. At school, my major project is the Queen's Formula SAE car for the 2023 season. For this year, I am the lead for the suspension, steering and braking systenms.

Outside of school and work, I am an avid outdoor enthusiest and woodworker. In the winter you'll see me skiing; In the summer I'm hiking, climbing or sailing with any spare time I can get.
